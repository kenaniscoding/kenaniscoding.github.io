#  **Thesis Paper**
Our group's thesis paper is about Grading and Sorting Carabao Mangoes using Machine Learning. We did this by getting training and testing 
our selected CNN model for classifying the ripeness and bruises. We also used computer vision techniques such as OpenCV and thresholding
to get the size of the mango.
